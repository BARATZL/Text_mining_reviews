Our file, 04_Text_Mining_pre_sectionA_team10.ipynb, became corrupted at some point in our project. It is not readable.

Thankfully, it only documents our first steps with text mining, and our attempts to apply text preprocessing to the total ~8,000,000 reviews.

The results made it clear that our input was too computationally expensive.

05_Text_Mining_sectionA_team10.ipynb represents the same applications that we used in the 04 file, only applied on a much smaller subsets.
As a result, the output is more interpretable and malleable.

Please refer to 05_Text_Mining_sectionA_team10.ipynb when assessing our text mining methods.
