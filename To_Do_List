Hi Shreya! Here is what I did today for the project:

- Created a virtual instance with a beefier RAM to process our larger files.
    * This should make it easier to review the reviews and users files.
- Converted .json to .parquet files.
    * .parquet files are a more efficient way of storing data. We got the review file size cut in half(!!!). From now on, use pd.read_parquet("filepath")
      to read user and review files into dataframes.
    * business file is still a .json since it small enough to process as a .json. For business.json, use pd.read_json("filepath", lines = True).
- Removed smaller virtual machine to reduce confusion.

Here is what can be done next:

- Checking null values
- Determining if subsetting is needed or if we can proceed with entire contents of files
- EDA things like average length of text in review per business type

Our work is contained in 820-process.ipynb on the VM. Once you finish your contributions, download the file and push the file to this repo. 
Don't forget to stop the VM once you're done!

Hey Aryan, here's the things i did so far!

- checked for null values. only the business file had null values in two columns (attributes, hours). 
   * i am still unsure about how we should proceed with dealing with these because business is a secondary file for our analysis. 
- subsetting doesn't seem to be necessary. all the files are running properly and quickly so far.
- merged review and users files on user_id
- EDA:
   * checked the average length of the review texts
   * created a couple plots of different relevant relationships
   * attempted to find the most common words used in the reviews, which crashed the kernel multiple times (please see if you can figure it out)
   * found the top 10 users (number can be changed) by number of reviews.
   * distribution of the frequency of stars
   * scatterplot about the r/s b/w review length and voted useful.

I think going forward you could do the following: 
- trying to see how to deal with the null values in business that makes sense for our project. we can discuss this too!
- figuring out how to get the code running for the most common words used in reviews.
- any further EDA you think is necessary
- if you're really zooming through all of this and feel like you have a lot of time, maybe starting with topic modeling on the reviews.
